## 💫 About Me:
👋 Hi there! I'm a MCA student at LPU Jalndhar focused on Cybersecurity, Network & System Administration, and Digital Forensics.

🛠️ I perform both passive and active reconnaissance using tools like dnsrecon, Sublist3r, Subfinder, Amass, and theHarvester for subdomain enumeration and OSINT, alongside Nmap, Masscan, and netcat for network   scanning and enumeration.

🔍 I utilize the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) with Filebeat and Sigma rules for log analysis, threat hunting, and incident response. I also work with Suricata, Sysmon, and OSSEC to enhance detection capabilities.

📡 Skilled in network packet analysis using Wireshark and tcpdump for traffic inspection, anomaly detection, and forensic investigation of network-based attacks.

🧪 I'm working on social media data extraction, forensic analysis, and digital evidence handling using Kali Linux and tools like Autopsy, FTK Imager, and other open-source forensic suites.

🌐 Experienced in configuring VLANs, ACLs, and inter-VLAN routing (Cisco), setting up Active Directory labs, and managing virtualized systems in VirtualBox.

🚀 Passionate about securing, optimizing, and investigating real-world IT environments through a balance of offensive and defensive techniques.
